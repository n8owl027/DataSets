The,data,consist,of,2001,observations,taken,from,a,balloon,about,30,kilometres
above,the,surface,of,the,earth.,In,the,section,of,the,flight,shown,here,the
balloon,increases,in,height.,As,radiation,increases,with,height,there,is,a
non-decreasing,trend,in,the,data.,The,outliers,are,caused,by,the,fact,that,the
balloon,slowly,rotates,,causing,the,ropes,from,which,the,measuring,instrument
is,suspended,to,cut,off,the,direct,radiation,from,the,sun.,The,first,column
contains,the,raw,data,,the,second,column,the,residuals,after,the,removal,of,a
non-decreasing,trend.
